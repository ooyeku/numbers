//! The `base` module provides a collection of mathematical functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
//! modulo, power, root, factorial, fibonacci, and various checks (prime, even, odd, perfect square, perfect cube, etc.). These functions
//! operate on i128 integers and may panic in some cases if input constraints are not met (e.g., negative exponents or divisors, or non-integer
//! roots), so it is important to ensure proper input values are provided.
