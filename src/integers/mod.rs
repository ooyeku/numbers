//! Integers module for implementing various mathematical operations on integers.
//! The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, power,
//! root, factorial, fibonacci, and various checks (prime, even, odd, perfect square,
//! perfect cube, etc.). The results are returned as a comma-separated string representing
//! the element-wise results of the applied operation.
//!
//! modules:
//! * `base`
//! * `complex_integers`
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use numbers_rus::integers::base;
//! use numbers_rus::integers::complex_integers;
//! ```
pub mod base;
pub mod complex_integers;
