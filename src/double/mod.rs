//! double is a module for implementing multiple vectors or matrices of either f64 or i128.
//! operations are applied from one vector to another (vector one element one to vector two element one, etc).
//!
//! modules:
//! * `double_vector`
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use numbers_rus::double;
//! ```
