//! Floats module for implementing various mathematical operations on floating-point numbers.
//! The operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, root, minimum, maximum, average,
//! median, and mode calculation. The results are returned as a comma-separated string representing the element-wise results
//! of the applied operation.
//!
//!  modules:
//! * `base_float`
//! * `complex_floats`
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use numbers_rus::floats::base_float;
//! use numbers_rus::floats::complex_floats;
//! ```
//!
